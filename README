MySQL server 5.3+

** Python Module requirements: **

MySQLdb (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/)


** How to install and run **

Connect to DB on mysql and create the schema using the file schema.sql:

mysql --user=<MYSQLUSERNAME> -p -D >MYSQLDATABASENAME> < schema.sql

You can make changes to schema.sql but only for the STATUSes in the insert statements.

First edit the db.py file to include your mysql database, user and password
Then run the below from a shell
$ python tasks.py


** TODO **

Todo is a list of things I hope to add in the next release and does not really include the complete to-do list

1. Categories and subcategories of bugs.
2. Archive bugs.
3. Report to show how many bugs were logged, solved in the past one week, month.
